# Quickstart REST API

This is an opinionated quick start project for nodejs, typescript & express.

You should be able to clone the project and then run:

`npm i`

Followed by `npm run dev`

The endpoint `http://localhost:7000/api/greetings/hello`

Should return
```
{
  "message": "Hello World"
}
```

Mostly for my personal use because I dislike creating boilerplate.
